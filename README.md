# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellations using Microsoft Excel, providing insights into guest booking patterns, cancellation trends, room allocation, and more.

## Project Overview
- **Data Source:** Hotel booking data.
- **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard visualization.
- **Objective:** Understand the patterns of booking and cancellations and visualize the insights in a user-friendly dashboard.

## Data Preparation
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
   - Created two new columns based on the analysis:
     - **`room_status`**: Indicates if the selected room was allotted as per the guest's request.
     - **`guest_type`**: Categorizes guests into groups such as "Couples," "Family," or "Single."

2. **Pivot Table Analysis**:
   - Created a pivot table to summarize and analyze booking data by guest type, booking month, room allocation, and more.

## Dashboard
The dashboard presents several visual insights derived from the pivot table:
- **Total Bookings and Cancellations**: Displays overall booking and cancellation numbers.
- **Guest Type Analysis**: Shows booking and cancellation patterns by guest type.
- **City-Wise Booking & Cancellation**: Compares bookings and cancellations between City Hotel and Resort Hotel.
- **Monthly Guest Bookings**: Highlights monthly booking and cancellation trends.
- **Room Allocation**: Shows how many rooms were allotted based on guest requests.
